# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

Welcome to my repository where I explore various data structures and algorithms using C++. This repository is intended as a personal reference and a resource for anyone interested in learning how to implement fundamental as well as advanced data structures and algorithms in C++.

## Contents

- **Basic Data Structures**
  - [Arrays](array.cpp)
  - [Linked Lists](linkedList.cpp)
  - [Stacks](stack.cpp)
  - [Queues](queue.cpp)
- **Advanced Data Structures**
  - [Binary Trees](binaryTree.cpp)
  - Hash Tables
  - Graphs
  - Heaps
- **Algorithms**
  - Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick, Heap)
  - Searching (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
  - Algorithmic Challenges (Various coding problems and their solutions)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. Examples include:
- GCC
- Clang
- MSVC

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sivasai126/DSA.git
```
### Usage

Navigate to the directory of the specific data structure or algorithm you want to explore and compile the code. For example:

```bash
g++ -o program Arrays/arrays_example.cpp
./program
```

Replace `Arrays/arrays_example.cpp` with the path to the specific file you want to compile.
